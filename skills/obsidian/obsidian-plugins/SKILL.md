# Obsidian Plugin & Theme Development — Reference Router

<context>

This skill provides a **local clone of the official [obsidian-developer-docs](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-developer-docs)**
at `references/`. Every `.md` file under `references/` is a page from [docs.obsidian.md](https://docs.obsidian.md/).
The references include: **Plugins** (lifecycle, APIs, UI, guides, releasing), **Reference** (manifest schema,
CSS variables, full TypeScript API — 1195 docs across 172 classes), **Themes** (app themes, Publish themes),
and **Policies** (developer policies, submission requirements, self-critique checklists).

**This skill does NOT contain the reference content itself.** It tells you which file to read and how to
search the references efficiently. Always read the referenced file before answering an implementation
question — the TypeScript API surface is large and versioned.

## Routing Table

<instructions>

When the user asks an Obsidian development question, match their intent below.
**Read the referenced file(s) before answering.** The table is ordered by development phase.

</instructions>

<routing>

<route name="new-plugin">

## Search Strategies

<instructions>

The TypeScript API alone has 1195 docs across 172 class directories. Search before guessing.

Prefer **`ripgrep` (`rg`)** for text search and **`fd`** for file-name lookup — always prefix
with **`rtk`** to compress output. Fall back to `grep_search` tool for workspace-scoped search.

</instructions>

### Find files by name (`fd`)

```bash
rtk fd "Plugin.md" references/Reference/TypeScript\ API       # class doc by name
rtk fd "process.md" references/Reference/TypeScript\ API       # method doc by name
rtk fd "\.md$" references/Plugins/Editor                       # all .md under a section
```

### Full-text search (`rg`)

```bash
rtk rg "registerView" references/                              # concept anywhere
rtk rg -C 2 "Vault.process" references/                        # with 2 lines context
rtk rg --type md "onLayoutReady" references/Plugins/Guides/    # scope to section
rtk rg -i "ItemView" references/Reference/TypeScript\ API/     # case-insensitive API lookup
```

### grep_search patterns (fallback tool)

| You need | Query pattern |
| --- | --- |
| How to register something | `registerView\|registerCommand\|registerEvent` |
| Vault file operations | `vault\.(read\|modify\|process\|delete\|trash)` |
| Editor decorations | `Decoration\|WidgetType\|ViewPlugin` |
| Settings / configuration | `settings\|loadData\|saveData\|SettingTab` |
| CSS variable for a component | `--button\|--modal\|--dialog\|--checkbox` |

### Scoped search by section

Prefix `rg` with the path, or use `grep_search` `includePattern`:

| Section | Path / `includePattern` |
| --- | --- |
| Getting started | `references/Plugins/Getting started/**` |
| User interface | `references/Plugins/User interface/**` |
| Editor | `references/Plugins/Editor/**` |
| Guides | `references/Plugins/Guides/**` |
| Releasing | `references/Plugins/Releasing/**` |
| CSS variables | `references/Reference/CSS variables/**` |
| TypeScript API | `references/Reference/TypeScript API/**` |

### Deep research

For multi-document questions, use the **Explore** subagent set to `thorough`. Example:

> Explore `references/Plugins/User interface/Views.md`,
> `references/Plugins/User interface/Settings.md`, and
> `references/Plugins/Getting started/Mobile development.md`
> for building a mobile-compatible plugin with custom views and settings.

## Critical Rules & Gotchas

<rules>

These are the most common reasons plugins get rejected or break at runtime.
Summarized from the reference docs — always read the full docs before submission.

### Security & Policy

+ **Never use `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, or `insertAdjacentHTML`** with user input. Use `createEl()`, `createDiv()`, `createSpan()` (`references/Plugins/User interface/HTML elements.md`).
+ **Never use `app` or `window.app`** — use `this.app` from your Plugin instance. The global is for debugging only.
+ **No client-side telemetry.** Server-side telemetry requires a privacy policy in the README.
+ **Don't set default hotkeys** for commands.
+ **Disclose network access in your README** — explain why and which services are contacted.
+ **Code cannot be obfuscated.**

### Code Quality

+ **Use Sentence case for all UI text** — "Template folder location", not "Template Folder Location".
+ **Don't assign styles via JavaScript or inline HTML** — use scoped CSS classes.
+ **Prefer `async`/`await` over raw `Promise` chains.**
+ **Never use `var`** — use `const` (preferred) or `let`.
+ **Check with `instanceof` before casting** to `TFile`, `TFolder`, or `FileSystemAdapter`.
+ **Release all resources in `onunload()`.** Use `registerEvent()`, `registerInterval()`, `registerDomEvent()` — they auto-cleanup on unload.
+ **Don't include plugin name/ID in command names** — Obsidian prefixes automatically.

### Mobile Compatibility

<small>

From `references/Plugins/Getting started/Mobile development.md`</small>

+ **Don't import `fs`, `path`, `electron` at top level.** Gate behind `Platform.isDesktopApp`.
+ **Don't cast `Vault.adapter` to `FileSystemAdapter`** without `instanceof` — on mobile it's `CapacitorAdapter`.
+ **Use `requestUrl()` not `fetch` or `axios`** — handles mobile CORS quirks.
+ **Use `Platform` API, not `process.platform`.**

</rules>

<gotchas>

+ **`Vault.process()` vs read()+modify():** Always prefer `process()` — it guarantees the file hasn't changed between read and write. For async: `cachedRead()` then `process()`, verifying data hasn't changed in the callback. See `references/Plugins/Vault.md`.
+ **View lifecycle:** Never store references to your view instances. Obsidian may call the view factory multiple times. Use `workspace.getLeavesOfType()` to find views. See `references/Plugins/User interface/Views.md`.
+ **Vault `create` event at startup:** Obsidian fires `vault.on('create')` for every file during init. Gate behind `workspace.onLayoutReady()` or check `workspace.layoutReady`. See `references/Plugins/Guides/Optimize plugin load time.md`.
+ **manifest.json `id` must match plugin folder name** for local dev — otherwise `onExternalSettingsChange` won't fire. See `references/Reference/Manifest.md`.
+ **Declarative settings need Obsidian ≥ 1.13.0** (`getSettingDefinitions()`). For older versions, use the legacy `display()` or dual-support pattern. See `references/Plugins/Guides/Migrate to declarative settings.md`.

</gotchas>

## API Version Awareness

<context>

The TypeScript API docs include version annotations (e.g., "0.9.7", "1.13.0") showing when each
method was introduced. See `references/Reference/Versions.md` for version history.

+ Set `minAppVersion` in manifest.json to the highest API version your plugin uses.
+ If a method requires "1.13.0", your plugin requires Obsidian ≥ 1.13.0.
</context>
